COVID cases and deaths data was gathered through Johns Hopkins. The importing of the data resulted in list data frames that required further work to be considered tidy. Functions were created to clean the data frame and subsequent tidying was conducted following the tidy data framework. Country population data was then added to create a robust data frame of country and COVID metrics. Analysis was then conducted to analyze how countries and regions were affected by the pandemic.
